# Differentiator

## Input
The input must contain an expression in full bracket notation. For example this:
```
((s ((5) * (x))) * ((c ((3) * (x)) ) ^ (3)) )
```

## Functions
My differentiator has the simplest trigonometric functions sine and cosine and they are denoted as s and c respectively.

## Output
The output of the program corresponds to those file (latex).

## Peculiarity
My differentiator also optimizes the resulting expression, for example, it folds the constants.
